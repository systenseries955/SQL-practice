# SQL-practice
Practiced key SQL concepts to strengthen my data analysis and querying skills.
Focused on applying essential commands such as:

SELECT for extracting specific data

COUNT() and SUM() for aggregating numeric insights

GROUP BY for summarizing data by categories

ORDER BY for sorting results

LIMIT for controlling output

This exercise enhanced my understanding of how SQL functions work together to organize, summarize, and analyze datasets efficiently.
Continuously building a strong foundation in SQL for data-driven problem solving and real-world analytics.
